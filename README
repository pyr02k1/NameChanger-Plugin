README

This plugin was designed for the {zA} servers (ZeroAlpha.us) in an attempt to catch and stop namechanger hacks. It is 
distributed under the GNU GPL v2. You can get a copy of this license from the FSF (Free Software Foundation). You are
required to distribute the source code of this script in the case of releasing it by any means.

To Setup:
Locate and open the extplugins/conf/namechangers.xml document. Inside, follow the various configuration methods to suit your
tastes
YOU MUST... I STRESS THIS !!!MUST!!! either disable logging or modify the log location to suit your system. IT IS ENABLED BY
DEFAULT. The default location is C:\NameChanger.log... I recommend you tie it to your home directory or the current server
location and rename it to be more descriptive (e.g. NameChangers-MainServer.log). YOU MUST disable if you plan not to use. If
you dont, the B3 bot may crash when it goes to log to the log file.

Logging methods:
all... This will enable full debugging with the property of writing ALL calls to the log file of choice as well as the b3 log
    file (This is equivalent to debug mode, just with writing to a physical file to limit additional info that goes with the
    normal b3 log)
debug... This method will be equivalent to the above, but with a limitation that it will only write the data to the b3 log
limited... Will write any name changes and kicks/bans to the namechanger log file and only write kicks/bans to the b3 log.
    In the case no LogLocation is specified, it will write all the limited data to the b3.log
minimal... This will only write kicks/bans to the b3 log and the LogLocation. If no LogLocation is specified (or 0), it will
    only log to the b3 log file.
none... This will disable logging completely. Nothing will be said to the logs. NOT recommended. Available due to a request
    for this feature. Not necessarily a good idea though. 
    
Limited method is enabled by default.
