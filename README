README

This plugin was designed for the {zA} servers (ZeroAlpha.us) in an attempt to catch and stop namechanger hacks. It is 
distributed under the GNU GPL v2. You can get a copy of this license from the FSF (Free Software Foundation). You are
required to distribute the source code of this script in the case of releasing it by any means.

To Setup:
Locate and open the extplugins/conf/namechangers.xml document. Inside, follow the various configuration methods to suit your
tastes
YOU MUST... I STRESS THIS !!!MUST!!! either disable logging or modify the log location to suit your system. IT IS ENABLED BY
DEFAULT. The default location is C:\NameChanger.log... I recommend you tie it to your home directory or the current server
location and rename it to be more descriptive (e.g. NameChangers-MainServer.log). YOU MUST disable if you plan not to use. If
you dont, the B3 bot may crash when it goes to log to the log file.
